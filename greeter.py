# Writing Clear Prompts
# Each time you use the input() function, you should include a clear, easy-to-follow prompt that tells the user exactly what kind of information you're looking for.
#name = input("Please enter your name: ")
#print(f"\nHello, {name}!")

#prompt = 'If you tell us who you are, we can personalize the messages you see'
#prompt += "\nWhat is your first name?"

#name = input(prompt)
#print(f"\nHello, {name}!")

# Using int() to Accept Numerical Input
#  When you use the input() function, Python interprets everything the user enters as a string. 
age = input("How old are you?")
